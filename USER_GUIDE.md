# ZeroTouch - User Guide

Welcome to **ZeroTouch**, your new gesture-controlled mouse assistant! This application allows you to control your computer mouse using simple hand gestures captured by your webcam.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Launch the App**: Double-click `ZeroTouch.exe`.
2.  **Wait for Camera**: A window will appear showing your webcam feed.
3.  **Position Yourself**: Ensure you are in a well-lit room and your hands are clearly visible to the camera.

## 🎮 Controls

ZeroTouch uses a two-handed control scheme for maximum precision.

### 🤚 Right Hand (Cursor & Scrolling)
Use your **RIGHT HAND** to move the mouse pointer and scroll pages.

| Gesture | Action | Visual Feedback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 Finger Up** (Index) | **Move Cursor** | 🟢 Green Cursor |
| **2 Fingers Up** (Index + Middle) | **Scroll Down** | 🔵 Blue Indicator |
| **3 Fingers Up** | **Scroll Up** | 🟡 Yellow Indicator |
| **4+ Fingers** | *Standby* | "Too Many Fingers" |

**💡 Tip:** To move the cursor, simply point with your index finger and move your hand. The cursor follows your finger!

### ✊ Left Hand (Clicking)
Use your **LEFT HAND** to click.

| Gesture | Action | Visual Feedback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Hand** | *Ready to Click* | 🟠 Orange Skeleton |
| **Make a Fist** | **Left Click** | 🔴 RED "CLICK!" |

**💡 Tip:** To click, quickly close your left hand into a fist and then open it again.

## 🎯 Usage Tips

*   **Green Border**: Keep your hands inside the **Green Border** shown on the screen. Movements outside this box might not be detected accurately.
*   **Lighting**: Good lighting is key! Avoid strong backlight (windows behind you).
*   **Distance**: Sit at a normal distance from your webcam (approx. 2-3 feet).
*   **Background**: A plain background helps the camera see your hands better.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

*   **"No hands detected"**: Move your hands closer to the camera or improve lighting.
*   **"Cursor is shaking"**: Try to keep your hand steady. The app has built-in smoothing, but very fast movements can still be jittery.
*   **App not closing**: Click the **'X'** on the window or press **'Q'** on your keyboard to quit.
